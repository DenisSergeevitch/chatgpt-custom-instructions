# ChatGPT Custom Instructions
My optimized custom instructions for ChatGPT that demonstrably improve performance.

[Previous version (v1)](v1.md)

## Performance Testing
I invested ~$200 to test these custom instructions against the complete MMLU benchmark - a comprehensive test designed to evaluate language models' capabilities across various domains including mathematics, history, physics, etc. The benchmark essentially tests how well LLMs can process information at a human-level understanding in different contexts.

**Key Finding**: Implementing these custom instructions improved task success rate by approximately 7% - a significant improvement in LLM performance metrics.

## What's New in This Version
The new version focuses on improved readability and response structure:
- Model provides a TL;DR before detailed explanations
- Model assigns itself realistic roles rather than fictional ones
